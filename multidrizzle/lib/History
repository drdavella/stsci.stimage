Multidrizzle Revision History
-----------------------------
Version 2.3.7: 11/08/04 -- WJH
    Methods were added to Manager to update the header of the final
    output product to report the MDRIZSKY values in HISTORY cards.
    
    PyDrizzle was also updated to correct the 'build=no'/'clean=yes'
    problem (where the output files were deleted), and to properly
    report the EXPTIME value for the D00*WTSC keyword.

Version 2.3.6: 10/13/04 -- WJH/CJH
    Have updated the minmed.py module to improve error handling and
    reporting in the case when the boxcar convolution within minmed
    fails.  

    Manager was updated to use an overlap region when
    iterating through images in the combine_median step.  This is
    to insure that the section size used is always at least as large
    as the kernel uxed in the boxcar for minmed.

    Finally, nimageiterator was modified to apply overlap regions
    correctly.

Version 2.3.5: 10/08/04 -- CJH
    Have updated the mdrizpars.py module with new default parameter
    values as specfied by Anton Koekmoer.

Version 2.3.4: 10/05/04 -- CJH/WJH
    Added logic to treat STIS sky subtraction differently than all
    other instruments. 

Version 2.3.3: 09/30/04 -- CJH
    Modified the DrizCR rountines to include the input image's combined
    primary and extension headers in the primary header of the resulting 
    cor and cr mask files.

Version 2.3.2: 09/28/04 -- CJH
    Updated versionInfo in __init__.py file to catch the case when
    pyraf is unable to be imported.

Version 2.3.1: 09/21/04 --- CJH/WJH
    Initial release of the redesigned Multidrizzle release to the larger
    STScI user community.  Earlier version of the code were dedicated
    efforts for installation in the ACS OPUS 15.4 calibration pipeline.
    The version of Multidrizzle delivered to OPUS 15.4 is v2.2.1.  This
    inital offereing to STScI differes from the v2.2.1 in that it has
    support for STIS and NICMOS data and an improved version of Pydrizzle
    that better supports sub-arrays.
