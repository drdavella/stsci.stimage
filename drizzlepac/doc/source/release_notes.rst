DrizzlePac Release Notes 
**************************************
The code for this package gets released through a number of methods: namely,
  - the use of the package for pipeline and archive processing of ACS and WFC3 data, 
  - SSB's semi-annual public release of the stsci_python package, and 
  - a weekly beta release of the development version.  
  
The following notes provide some details on what has been revised for each version in
reverse chronological order (most recent version at the top of the list).

DrizzlePac(astrodrizzle) v1.0.6(14-Aug-2012)
--------------------------------------------
**available starting:** Aug 20, 2012

Use of IVM for final_wht now correct, as previous code used wrong inputs when IVM weighting was automatically generated by astrodrizzle.

DrizzlePac(astrodrizzle) v1.0.5(8-Aug-2012)
--------------------------------------------
**available starting:** Aug 13, 2012

- Completely removed the use of the TIME arrays for weighting IR drizzle products so that the photometry for saturated sources in drizzled products now comes out correct.
- Corrected a problem with astrodrizzle which affected processing of WFPC2 data where CRPIX2 was not found when creating the output single sci image.
