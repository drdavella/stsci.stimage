The structure of the stsci_python repository is changing.  Don't
expect to just check out what is here and get everything (or even
the "subset of everything" that used to be here).


To check out all of the stsci_python source
-------------------------------------------

	svn checkout https://svn.stsci.edu/svn/ssb/stsci_python/stsci_python/trunk/new_install

	set path = ( $cwd/new_install $path )

	cd /where/you/want/all/the/packages

	stp_list | stp_checkout
		# checks out the trunk

For now, I suspect you do not need to work on a branch.  If you do,
talk to Mark.  If you make a branch of stsci_python, it will be
very hard to merge back in a week or two.
